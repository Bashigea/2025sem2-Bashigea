# Repository for DST 490
**Semester: Spring 2026**

- Files are organized by the day that they occur in the [course calendar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IkLp4tm9vqroM48c2gDwmllNh6jdlmhbe72HFHFL3UE/edit?tab=t.0).

- **To track changes in the upstream repo**, use the following command in the terminal (one time only: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/AugsburgDST490/augsburgdst490-2025SEM2_Files.git`

- **To check** use the following command in the terminal: `git remote -v` You should see `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the class repo).

- **To update your fork with any changes:** Do this before beginning new work and whenever they want any updates.
  - `git checkout main`  (it may already say you are on main)
  - `git rebase upstream/main`
